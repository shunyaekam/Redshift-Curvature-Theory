# Curvature-Work Theory of Cosmological Redshift: Complete Reference

**Authors**: Eric Henning (SNHU), Aryan Singh (Open University)  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 2025

## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for an alternative interpretation of cosmological redshift based on curvature-work effects. The theory proposes that observed redshift consists of two components: standard cosmological expansion and energy loss from photons performing "work" to escape gravitational potential wells. This framework addresses the Hubble Tension and provides a geometric foundation for understanding photon behavior in curved spacetime.

## 1. Core Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Fundamental Hypothesis

**Primary Assertion**: Observed cosmological redshift (z) has two distinct physical components:

```
z_observed = z_expansion + z_curvature_work
```

Where:
- `z_expansion`: Traditional cosmological expansion component
- `z_curvature_work`: Energy loss from photons escaping gravitational/curvature wells

### 1.2 Curvature-Work Mechanism

**Physical Process**: Photons lose energy performing geometric "work" to achieve null propagation (ds² = 0) when escaping regions of high spacetime curvature.

**Key Principle**: Null propagation becomes **emergent** rather than fundamental:
- In flat spacetime: photons naturally propagate at speed c
- In curved spacetime: photons must expend energy to maintain null geodesic paths
- In extreme curvature: photons may lose their null nature entirely

### 1.3 Energy Conservation Framework

**Global Energy Conservation**: Energy lost by escaping photons is absorbed by the curvature field itself, not dissipated thermodynamically.

**Curvature Field Properties**:
- Non-arbitrary geometric field embedded within 4D spacetime
- Not an external scalar field (like Higgs or inflaton)
- Determines permission for causal structure existence
- Stores and redistributes energy across cosmic evolution

## 2. Mathematical Formulation

### 2.1 Primary Correction Model

**H₀ Correction Formula**:
```
H₀_corrected = H₀_apparent × (1 - α × f(environment_depth))
```

**Parameters**:
- `α`: Correction strength parameter (typical values: 0.01 - 0.10)
- `f(depth)`: Functional form of environment dependence
- `environment_depth`: Normalized proxy for gravitational potential depth

**Functional Forms**:
- **Linear**: `f(depth) = depth_normalized`
- **Quadratic**: `f(depth) = depth_normalized²`
- **Exponential**: `f(depth) = 1 - exp(-2 × depth_normalized)`

### 2.2 Environment Depth Proxies

**Strong Lens Systems**: `log σ_v` (velocity dispersion in km/s)
**Supernova Systems**: `log M_host` (host galaxy mass in solar masses)

**Normalization**: All proxies mapped to [0,1] range for consistent comparison

### 2.3 Kretschmann Scalar Threshold

**Critical Curvature**: Local scalar curvature threshold K_crit where null propagation begins to fail.

**Threshold Condition**:
```
K = R_abcd R^abcd ≥ K_crit
```

When K > K_crit:
- Photons begin losing energy to maintain null propagation
- Coordinate speed of light may differ from local speed c
- Extreme cases: photons become trapped as massive objects (E = mc²)

### 2.4 Temporal Evolution

**Cosmic Time Dependence**: Curvature wells become shallower over cosmic time, leading to:
- Early photons: Higher energy loss (more work required)
- Later photons: Lower energy loss (less work required)
- This explains apparent acceleration in expansion measurements

## 3. Geometric Foundation

### 3.1 Non-Riemannian Framework

**Geometric Structure**: Extension of General Relativity maintaining core predictive power while allowing:
- Non-smooth metric behavior across curvature boundaries
- Emergent null condition from curvature field dynamics
- Global topology embedded within 4D spacetime

### 3.2 Hypersphere/N-Sphere Topology

**5-Dimensional Universe Hypothesis**: Our 4D experience as projection of hypersphere
- Not string theory (avoids arbitrary compact dimensions)
- Observable hypersphere volume through normal space
- Photons as geodesics representing volume distribution

**Volume Conservation**: Photon redshift represents quantum distribution of hypersphere volume

### 3.3 Positive Mass Theorem Applications

**Non-Smooth Metrics**: Based on Almaraz & Wang (2025) work on positive mass theorems for non-smooth metrics across compact hypersurfaces.

**Key Results**:
- Mass conservation across curvature discontinuities
- Geometric interpretation of energy storage in curvature fields
- Mathematical framework for non-singular curved regions

## 4. Observational Implications

### 4.1 Hubble Tension Resolution

**Systematic Bias Explanation**: If late-time H₀ measurements include less curvature-work than early-time measurements:
- CMB-derived H₀ (early universe): Includes maximum curvature work
- SN/Cepheid H₀ (late universe): Includes reduced curvature work
- Results in apparent tension without new physics

### 4.2 Observational Tests

**Primary Targets**:
1. **Strong Lens Time-Delays**: H0LiCOW/TDCOSMO systems
2. **Supernova Host Environments**: Pantheon+ galaxy mass correlations
3. **Black Hole Environments**: Event horizon photon behavior
4. **Primordial Black Holes**: Early universe curvature work signatures

**Observable Signatures**:
- Environment-dependent H₀ measurements
- Correlation between host galaxy mass and apparent H₀
- Time evolution of curvature work contribution

### 4.3 Black Hole Interior Predictions

**Singularity Redefinition**: No true singularities, instead:
- Photons gain energy approaching event horizon
- At some point, photons cannot maintain c due to energy gain
- "Singularity" becomes region where photons exist as massive objects
- Provides geometric explanation for information paradox
