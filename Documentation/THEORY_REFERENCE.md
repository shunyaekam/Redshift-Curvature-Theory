## Abstract

We present a theoretical framework proposing that observed cosmological redshift consists of two distinct physical components: standard cosmological expansion and energy loss from photons performing geometric "work" to escape gravitational potential wells. This curvature-work mechanism provides a potential resolution to the Hubble Tension through systematic reinterpretation of redshift measurements, without invoking new particle species and potentially reducing or obviating the need for dark energy (subject to observational tests). The theory extends General Relativity by incorporating a non-arbitrary curvature field embedded within spacetime structure, leading to emergent null propagation conditions and novel predictions for photon behavior in extreme gravitational environments.

## Claim Strength Legend

**Established**: Standard GR/cosmology results we recover.
**Hypothesis**: Core curvature-work framework and H₀ bias mechanism.
**Speculative**: Hypersphere program, entanglement link, information-flow remarks.

We will clearly tag sections accordingly.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Core Hypothesis

The fundamental premise of curvature-work theory is that cosmological redshift z_observed decomposes as:

```
z_observed = z_expansion + z_curvature_work
```

where z_expansion represents traditional cosmological expansion and z_curvature_work accounts for photon energy loss during escape from gravitational potential wells. This decomposition challenges the standard interpretation that redshift serves as a direct proxy for cosmic expansion rates.

### 1.2 The Curvature Field

We propose a geometric curvature field C(x,t) that is intrinsically woven into spacetime structure, distinct from auxiliary scalar fields such as the Higgs or inflaton fields. This field possesses three key properties:

1. **Geometric Embedding**: The field is topologically integrated within 4-dimensional spacetime rather than imposed as an external overlay
2. **Causal Permission**: The field determines local conditions for null propagation, effectively controlling where spacetime structure permits causal relationships
3. **Energy Storage**: The field can absorb and redistribute photon energy globally, maintaining cosmic energy conservation

### 1.3 Emergent Null Propagation

Under this framework, the null condition ds² = 0 becomes emergent rather than fundamental. In regions of extreme curvature, photons may lose their null nature as they expend energy to maintain propagation paths. This leads to a critical insight: spacetime structure exists meaningfully only where photons can achieve null propagation.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Metric Modulation

The curvature field influences spacetime geometry through metric modulation in extreme curvature regions. The essential line element contracts for light-like curves according to local curvature field strength, leading to effective, curvature-dependent responses in the metric components g_μν **within** the GR framework. The Einstein equations are recovered in the appropriate limits; any deviations are emergent/effective rather than fundamental modifications.

### 2.2 Energy Conservation

Photon energy lost during curvature escape is absorbed by the curvature field itself:

```
∂E_photon/∂τ + ∂E_curvature/∂τ = 0
```

This global energy bookkeeping is a speculative avenue we will explore in relation to quantum non-local correlations; **it is not a claim of explanation at this stage.**

### 2.3 Threshold Physics

We hypothesize the existence of a critical curvature threshold, potentially involving the Kretschmann scalar:

```
K = R_abcd R^abcd ≥ K_crit
```

Beyond this threshold, photons can no longer maintain null propagation, transitioning to **effectively massive** behavior in extreme curvature, consistent with E = mc²; this is a hypothesis to be formalized.

## 3. Observational Implications

### 3.1 Hubble Tension Resolution

The theory naturally explains the Hubble Tension through systematic measurement biases:

- **Early Universe (CMB)**: Measurements include maximum curvature-work from deeper primordial wells
- **Late Universe (SNe/Cepheids)**: Measurements reflect reduced curvature-work from shallower contemporary wells
- **Systematic Bias**: Apparent H₀ discrepancy arises from different curvature-work contributions rather than new physics

These statements denote a working hypothesis; quantitative fits await the full data integration described in §6.

### 3.2 Observational Signatures

Primary observational tests focus on:

1. **Strong Gravitational Lensing**: Time-delay measurements in H0LiCOW systems provide direct probes of curvature-work effects
2. **Environment Correlation**: Systematic variation of apparent H₀ with host galaxy mass and velocity dispersion
3. **Redshift Evolution**: Temporal changes in curvature-work contribution across cosmic history

### 3.4 Falsifiable Predictions

**Key Testable Predictions:**

1. **H₀ decreases monotonically with environment depth** after correcting for lens-model systematics (sign and slope specified).

2. **Chromatic residuals in time-delay distances** if curvature-work couples to frequency-dependent paths (bounds to be derived).

3. **No degradation of CMB acoustic peak fits** when curvature-work is turned off at recombination (GR limit).

### 3.3 Black Hole Physics

The theory predicts novel black hole interior structure:

- **Energy Gain Mechanism**: Photons gain energy approaching event horizons until null propagation becomes impossible
- **Singularity Redefinition**: Traditional singularities become regions where photons exist as massive objects
- **Information Resolution**: Geometric energy storage offers a **speculative** angle on information retention/flow; **no resolution is claimed.**

## 4. Hypersphere Geometric Framework (Speculative Program)

### 4.1 Higher-Dimensional Structure

We propose that observable 4-dimensional spacetime represents a projection of an underlying 5-dimensional hypersphere. This differs fundamentally from string theory approaches by avoiding arbitrary compact dimensions and maintaining observational accessibility of the full geometric structure.

### 4.2 Photon-Volume Relationship

Within this framework, photons serve as elementary geodesics representing the hypersphere's volume distribution. Redshift emerges from photons "shredding" hypersphere volume during propagation, leading to quantum volume redistribution effects.

## 5. Cosmological Consequences

### 5.1 Inflation Compatibility

The theory preserves inflationary cosmology while revising post-inflationary expansion interpretation:

- **CMB Physics**: Peak structure remains intact within the General Relativity limit
- **E-fold Budget**: Some inferred expansion may reflect curvature-work misinterpretation
- **Late-Time Revision**: Primary modifications affect post-inflationary epoch expansion history

### 5.2 Dark Energy Alternative

Curvature-work effects may account for apparent cosmic acceleration without requiring dark energy:

- **Systematic Redshift**: Late-time measurements underestimate curvature-work contribution
- **Temporal Evolution**: Shallowing curvature wells create apparent acceleration signatures
- **Energy Budget**: Could reduce or obviate the inferred dark-energy component if supported by data; this is a testable alternative, not an established result.

### 5.3 Structure Formation

The theory predicts enhanced early structure formation through:

- **Primordial Black Holes**: Curvature-work energy release creates fertile formation environments
- **Energy Concentration**: Local energy absorption promotes gravitational collapse
- **Galaxy Formation**: High-redshift luminous galaxies (e.g., JADES-GS-z14-0) supported by energy release mechanisms
