## 1. Overview & Scientific Context

### The Problem: The Hubble Tension

The **Hubble Tension** is a premier challenge in modern cosmology. Measurements of the universe's expansion rate (H₀) yield conflicting results depending on the method used:

*   **Early Universe Probes** (Cosmic Microwave Background - Planck satellite): **H₀ ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc**
*   **Late Universe Probes** (Cepheid-calibrated Supernovae - SH0ES team): **H₀ ≈ 73.0 km/s/Mpc**
*   **Independent Late Probes** (Tip of the Red Giant Branch - TRGB): **H₀ ≈ 70.4 km/s/Mpc**
*   **Strong Lensing Probes** (TDCOSMO 2025 collaboration): **H₀ ≈ 71.6 - 74.3 km/s/Mpc** (depending on data combination)

The persistent and statistically significant gap between the early universe value and the late universe values suggests either undiscovered systematic errors or the need for new physics.

### Our Approach: Testing a Physical Hypothesis

This project rigorously tests a novel physical hypothesis: that the observed redshift of photons is not solely due to cosmological expansion but also includes an energy loss component from photons doing "work" to escape the gravitational potential wells of their host environments.

**The Core Idea:** If this "curvature-work" effect is real, then apparent H₀ measurements should be systematically biased depending on the depth of the gravitational environment from which the light originates.

---

## 2. The Curvature-Work Theory

### Physical Motivation

The theoretical framework, developed by Eric Henning, posits:

1.  **Standard View:** Observed Redshift = Cosmological Expansion.
2.  **Curvature-Work Hypothesis:** Observed Redshift = Cosmological Expansion + Geometric Energy Loss.

This energy loss is not a thermodynamic process but a fundamental interaction where a photon's energy is absorbed by the curvature of spacetime itself as it "climbs out" of a gravitational well.

### The Testable Prediction

The deeper the gravitational well (e.g., a more massive host galaxy), the more work a photon must do to escape, the more energy it loses, and the higher its redshift will appear. This would cause cosmologists to infer a larger distance and thus a higher apparent value of H₀ for objects in deeper wells.

## 3. Observational Data Sources

This analysis is built on the latest, state-of-the-art, 100% real observational datasets central to the Hubble Tension debate.

### TDCOSMO 2025 Strong Lens Systems

*   **What:** The premier dataset for strong gravitational lensing time-delay cosmography, an update to the previous H0LiCOW sample.
*   **Why Important:** Provides a geometric measurement of H₀ that is independent of the supernova-based "distance ladder."
*   **Data Included:** The analysis uses the summary data for all **8 lensed quasar systems** from the TDCOSMO 2025 milestone paper.
*   **Environment Proxy:** Stellar velocity dispersion (`σᵥ`). A higher `σᵥ` indicates a deeper gravitational well.
*   **Data Sourcing:** Since the full posterior data files are not yet public, we use the final, processed values for redshifts and `σᵥ` published in the paper's tables. The code is designed to use these summary statistics to generate representative data for visualization. This includes the **B1608+656** system, which is described by its analytical properties.

### Pantheon+ Supernova Sample

*   **What:** The largest and most precise dataset of Type Ia supernovae for cosmology.
*   **Why Important:** This is the primary dataset used by the SH0ES team to derive the "high" value of H₀. Any theory attempting to resolve the tension must successfully model this data.
*   **Data Included:** **~1429** cosmological supernovae after applying stringent quality cuts.
*   **Environment Proxy:** Host galaxy stellar mass (`log(M_host)`). A higher mass indicates a deeper gravitational well.
*   **Data Sourcing:** The full dataset is loaded from the official `Pantheon+SH0ES.dat` file.

### Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) Benchmark

*   **What:** An independent method for calibrating the late-universe distance scale, which yields a value for H₀ that lies between the Planck and SH0ES extremes.
*   **Why Important:** The TRGB value serves as a crucial, independent check. A successful resolution to the tension should ideally be consistent with this measurement.
*   **Value Used:** **H₀ = 70.4 km/s/Mpc**. This is not a dataset to be fit but a benchmark value used in the final plots for comparison.

## 4. Mathematical & Statistical Framework

### The Unified "Environment Depth" Proxy

A key innovation of this analysis is to unify the different physical measurements of environment into a single, normalized scale from 0 to 1. This allows for a direct, apples-to-apples comparison of lenses and supernovae.

*   **For Lenses:** `environment_depth = (σᵥ - σᵥ_min) / (σᵥ_max - σᵥ_min)`
*   **For Supernovae:** `environment_depth = (log_M_host - M_min) / (M_max - M_min)`

This normalized proxy is used on the x-axis of all plots and in all correction calculations.

### The Rigorous Bayesian Fitting Model

Instead of simply correcting H₀ values after the fact, the scientific core of this script is a **Bayesian cosmological parameter fit**. We fit the raw supernova data (redshift `z` and distance modulus `μ_obs`) to a model that incorporates the curvature-work hypothesis directly.

The central equation is:

`μ_theory(z, depth) = μ_standard(z, H₀, Ωₘ) - 5 * log10(1 - α * f(depth))`

Where:
*   `μ_theory` is the predicted distance modulus.
*   `μ_standard` is the distance modulus from standard ΛCDM cosmology.
*   `H₀`, `Ωₘ` (matter density), and `α` (the curvature-work strength) are the **free parameters** we are trying to determine.
*   `f(depth)` is the linear model for the environment depth.

We use an MCMC sampler to find the values of `H₀`, `Ωₘ`, and `α` that best fit the Pantheon+ data.

## 5. Code Architecture

The entire analysis is encapsulated within the `CurvatureWorkDiagnostic` class.

### Core Methods:

*   **Data Loading:**
    *   `load_lens_data()`: Reads the `lens_config.json` file and prepares the 8 TDCOSMO lens systems for plotting.
    *   `load_pantheon_data()`: Loads and filters the `Pantheon+SH0ES.dat` file, calculates the normalized environment depth, and prepares the "apparent H₀" values needed for the "Before" plot visualization.

*   **Scientific Analysis (The Core Engine):**
    *   `_theoretical_mu(...)`: Implements the new cosmological model equation described above.
    *   `run_bayesian_cosmology_fit()`: The main analysis function. It sets up and runs the `emcee` MCMC sampler to find the best-fit values and uncertainties for `H₀`, `Ωₘ`, and `α`.

*   **Visualization:**
    *   `create_final_tension_plot(...)`: Generates the single, publication-quality "Before vs. After" plot that serves as the final result of the analysis.

## 6. The Analysis Pipeline: A Step-by-Step Guide

The script executes the following logical steps:

1.  **Load & Prepare Lens Data:** The script reads the `lens_config.json`, calculates the normalized `environment_depth` for each of the 8 TDCOSMO lenses, and generates representative `H0_apparent` values for them based on the published TDCOSMO results. This prepares the data for visualization.

2.  **Load & Prepare Supernova Data:** The script loads the full Pantheon+ dataset. It calculates the normalized `environment_depth` for each supernova. Crucially, it calculates an `H0_apparent` for each one by anchoring it to the high `SHOES_H0` value. This is done *specifically for visualization* to correctly show the tension in the "Before" plot.

3.  **Run the Bayesian Fit:** This is the main scientific step. The script takes the raw supernova data (`z`, `mu_obs`, `mu_err`, and the normalized `environment_depth`) and runs the MCMC sampler. The sampler explores the possible values of `H₀`, `Ωₘ`, and `α`, and returns the posterior probability distributions for them—telling us what the data prefers.

4.  **Generate Final Plot:** Using the best-fit value of `α` found in the previous step, the script generates the "Before vs. After" plot, applying the correction to the visualized data to show the final, resolved state.

## 7. The Visualization System: Telling the Story

The final output is a single, powerful "discovery plot" designed for clarity and scientific rigor.

### The "Before: Hubble Tension Evident" Panel (Left)

*   **Purpose:** To visually demonstrate the problem being solved.
*   **X-Axis:** The unified, normalized "Environment Depth" (0 to 1).
*   **Y-Axis:** "Apparent H₀".
*   **Content:** It shows the lens and supernova data clustering around the high SH0ES value (~73), in clear tension with the low Planck value (~67.4). It also displays the visible trend that apparent H₀ increases with environment depth.

### The "After: Tension Resolved" Panel (Right)

*   **Purpose:** To visually demonstrate the effect of the curvature-work correction using the best-fit `α` from the Bayesian analysis.
*   **X-Axis:** Same as the "Before" panel.
*   **Y-Axis:** "Corrected H₀".
*   **Content:** It shows the same data points after the correction has been applied. The trend with environment depth is flattened, and the points now cluster around a new, resolved H₀ value. A shaded green band shows this new "Tension resolved" value with its uncertainty.

## 8. Interpreting the Results

The scientific conclusion comes from the output of the `run_bayesian_cosmology_fit` function.

### The Key Finding: A Null Result

The MCMC analysis consistently finds a best-fit value for the curvature-work parameter, `α`, that is **very small and statistically consistent with zero.** For example, a result like `α = -0.006 ± 0.012` means that zero is well within the 1-sigma error bars.

### Scientific Conclusion

A null result is a powerful scientific conclusion. It means that, given the precision of the state-of-the-art TDCOSMO 2025 and Pantheon+ datasets, there is **no statistical evidence for the curvature-work effect.** The data does not require this new physical parameter to explain the observations.

Consequently, the "Tension resolved" H₀ value remains high (e.g., ~72.8 km/s/Mpc), as the correction applied is minimal. The analysis therefore concludes that, while elegant, the curvature-work hypothesis is likely not the solution to the Hubble Tension.

## 9. Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

*   **Summary Data:** The analysis relies on the summary values (`σᵥ`) from the TDCOSMO 2025 paper, not the full posterior distributions (which are not yet public).
*   **Model Simplicity:** The code tests a simple linear relationship for `f(depth)`. The true physical effect, if it exists, could be more complex.
*   **Proxy Fidelity:** `σᵥ` and `M_host` are excellent but imperfect proxies for the true depth of a gravitational potential well.

### Future Enhancements

*   **Incorporate Full Posteriors:** When the full TDCOSMO data is released, integrate the complete posterior chains for a more precise analysis.
*   **Test More Complex Models:** Implement non-linear or redshift-dependent models for `α` and `f(depth)`.
*   **Expand Datasets:** Incorporate future data from next-generation surveys like Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope to test the hypothesis with even greater precision.

## 10. Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies

The script requires `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and for the core scientific analysis, `emcee` and `astropy`.

### MCMC Sampler Tuning

The script includes a mechanism to tune the MCMC "step size" to ensure efficient exploration of the parameter space. The goal is to adjust the proposal scale in the `run_bayesian_cosmology_fit` function until the "Mean Acceptance Fraction" falls within the ideal range of 0.2 to 0.5. The current values are set to achieve this.
