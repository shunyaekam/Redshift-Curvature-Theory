## 🌌 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete research framework for the **Curvature-Work Theory of Cosmological Redshift**, a novel approach to understanding cosmic observations that challenges the expansion-only interpretation of redshift.

### 🔬 Core Hypothesis

**Revolutionary Insight**: Observed cosmological redshift consists of two distinct physical components:

```
z_observed = z_expansion + z_curvature_work
```

1. **Standard Expansion**: Traditional cosmological expansion component
2. **Curvature Work**: Energy loss from photons performing "work" to escape gravitational/curvature wells

**Key Implication**: The Hubble Tension may result from systematic misinterpretation of curvature-work effects as pure expansion.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Resolve Hubble Tension** through geometric reinterpretation rather than new physics
2. **Develop Observable Signatures** testable with current astronomical data
3. **Create Mathematical Framework** extending General Relativity to non-smooth regimes
4. **Establish Simulation Platform** for testing curvature-work predictions

### Key Research Questions
- Is redshift solely an indicator of expansion, or does it include photon energy loss?
- Can systematic environment-dependent biases explain H₀ measurements discrepancies?
- What happens to photons in regions where null propagation becomes impossible?
- How does curvature-work theory connect to quantum mechanics and black hole physics?

## 🧮 Mathematical Framework

### Core Correction Model
```
H₀_corrected = H₀_apparent × (1 - α × f(environment_depth))
```

**Parameters:**
- `α`: Correction strength (0.01 - 0.10)
- `f(depth)`: Functional form (linear, quadratic, exponential)
- `environment_depth`: Normalized gravitational potential proxy

**Environment Proxies:**
- **Strong Lenses**: log σ_v (velocity dispersion)
- **Supernovae**: log M_host (host galaxy mass)

### Theoretical Extensions
- **Kretschmann Scalar Threshold**: Critical curvature for null propagation breakdown
- **Hypersphere Topology**: 5D universe with 4D projection
- **Energy Conservation**: Global curvature field energy storage

---

## 🔬 Current Implementation

### CurvatureWorkH0Diagnostic Simulation
**Purpose**: First observational test of curvature-work effects on H₀ measurements

**Data Sources:**

- **Pantheon+**: Simulated supernova host galaxy data (→ real data integration planned)

**Key Features:**

- Interactive Jupyter notebook interface
- Modular, extensible codebase

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to simulation directory
cd "CurvatureWorkH0Diagnostic"

## 🔬 Theoretical Foundations

### Key Physics Concepts

**Null Propagation Emergence**: ds² = 0 becomes emergent rather than fundamental
- Flat spacetime: Natural photon propagation at c
- Curved spacetime: Photons expend energy to maintain null paths
- Extreme curvature: Photons lose null nature, become massive

**Curvature Field Properties**:
- Embedded within 4D spacetime (not external scalar field)
- Determines permission for causal structure existence
- Stores and redistributes energy globally
- Explains quantum entanglement through energy conservation

**General Relativity Extension**:
- Maintains core GR predictive power
- Extends to non-smooth metric regimes
- Preserves local physics and causality
- Provides geometric foundation for information paradox resolution
